## mitWeather Mobile

⛅ mitWeather Mobile is a project that I developed in my free time to consolidate what I learned in a self-taught way from **React Native**, it is a native mobile application to check the weather of any location

🖥️ It is the continuation of my previous project, which was a SPA written in React and Redux, from which I recycled a large part of the functional code, which I adapted and optimized.

🖼️ As for the front, all the code was rewritten from scratch to use native components, trying to make minimalism prevail, trying to get rid of everything that could hinder the user experience. Each tactile component provides a different haptic response to make use more immersive.

New features were also added, among which I highlight:

🔎 Real-time city suggestions as you type
📌 Access permissions to exact location through GPS for search through coordinates
🔄️ Pull to refresh
💾 Use of local storage to keep the search data when closing the application, so when reopening it, the last searches are recovered and a refresh is performed
📳 Haptic (vibration) feedback when interacting with interface elements
🌤 Change of units between metric and imperial system (Celsius / Fahrenheit)
🎨 Icon and splash screen design

🛍️ In case you want to try it, it is already available in the android Play Store: https://lnkd.in/dar6BDat

Some of the technologies used are:

* React Native
* Redux
* Redux Persist
* Android Studio
